# Pig Game - Dice Rolling Game

## Overview
Pig Game is a simple dice-rolling game where two players take turns to roll a die and accumulate points. The goal is to be the first player to reach a total of 50 points. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during their turn, and the turn passes to the other player. Players can choose to "hold" their current turn points and add them to their total score, passing the turn to the other player.

This project is a digital implementation of the classic Pig Game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
